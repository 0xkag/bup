Notable changes in 0.27.1 as compared to 0.27
=============================================

May require attention
---------------------

* In previous versions, a `--sparse` restore might have produced
  incorrect data.  Please treat any existing `--sparse` restores as
  suspect.  The problem should be fixed in this release, and the
  `--sparse` tests have been substantially augmented.
