Notable changes in 0.29.3 as compared to 0.29.2
===============================================

General
-------

* Newer versions of par2 can process in parallel using multiple
  threads/cores, and they do so automatically.  This ends up competing
  with `bup fsck`s own parallelism, enabled by `-j`, in such a way
  that the command can actually run much *slower* (and be much more
  expensive) than it would have been with no parallelism at all.

  When appropriate `bup fsck` now disables par2's competing
  parallelism (via its `-t1` option) to avoid the contention.

Build system
------------

* test-prune-older should no longer be disturbed by git's automatic
  background gc.

Thanks to (at least)
