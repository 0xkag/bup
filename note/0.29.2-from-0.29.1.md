Notable changes in 0.29.2 as compared to 0.29.1
===============================================

May require attention
---------------------

* Non-python commands like import-rdiff-backup and import-rsnapshot
  should now be installed correctly.  Previously they might be
  truncated during the install.

Build system
------------

* The `bup rm` tests should be less sensitive to variations in git's
  output.

* The superuser detection on CygWin should work with newer systems.

Thanks to (at least)
