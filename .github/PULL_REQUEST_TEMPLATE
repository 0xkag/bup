First off, thanks for the help.

Note that we handle development on the mailing list, so if you're
comfortable with "git send-email" (or the equivalent), please post
your patches there as described in the "Submitting Patches" section in
./HACKING:

  https://github.com/bup/bup/blob/master/HACKING

However, if you're more comfortable with PRs, that's just fine.
Someone will eventually redirect the PR it to the list for review, and
you will of course be included in the conversation there.

In either case, assuming you're comfortable with it, please make sure
to include a Signed-off-by header in each commit message as described
in ./SIGNED-OFF-BY:

  https://github.com/bup/bup/blob/master/SIGNED-OFF-BY

i.e. a line like this in your commit messages:

  Signed-off-by: Someone <someone@somewhere>
